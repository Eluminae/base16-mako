# base16-mako

This is a repository that provides a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) template to generate theme
settings for [mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako).

To use, just pick a config snippet from colors/ and put it in your mako configuration, however you want.

The color mapping is based on [base16 sway](https://github.com/rkubosz/base16-sway).
